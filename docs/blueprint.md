## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#7F6610) to convey elegance and professionalism, as requested by the user. This is suitable, as a dark hue like gold is very appropriate for a dark scheme.
- Background color: Very light gold (#F2F0EC). This provides a contrasting backdrop that allows the primary gold to pop.
- Accent color: Russet (#804617) for calls to action. It is analogous to the gold, but different enough to draw the eye.
- Body font: 'Inter' for a modern, neutral look, suitable for the application's mix of shorter and longer passages of text.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', paired with 'Inter'. This provides a contemporary, techy touch suitable for headlines.
- Use professional, minimalist icons representing committees, actions, and status indicators.
- Modern, clean layout with clear information hierarchy, using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and ease of styling.
